An Ongoing Project to Convert Boring Geography Slides to Hype Talk-Show Podcasts

## How it Works
GeoTalks is an AI-powered project that transforms classroom slide presentations into dynamic podcast episodes. Using slide decks provided, we generate audio content featuring two virtual hosts who discuss and break down the material in a conversational, engaging format.

The process begins with uploading the teacher’s slides into NotebookLM, Google's AI research assistant. NotebookLM analyses the content, identifies key concepts, and generates structured outputs such as summaries, timelines, and study guides. This structured data is then used to script and produce an AI-generated podcast episode, complete with two hosts "yapping" about the content in an informal, accessible style.

Each episode aims to make academic content easier to absorb, review, and revisit—whether you're studying for a test or need a refresher. All audio is embedded directly into the site, organised by topic for simple navigation.

GeoTalks reimagines traditional study methods by leveraging cutting-edge AI tools, making geography more engaging, memorable, and fun to learn.
